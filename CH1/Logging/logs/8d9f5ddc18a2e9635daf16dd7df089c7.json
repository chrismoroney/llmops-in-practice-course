To make sure your talk is engaging and impactful, let's start by narrowing down the focus a bit. Here are a few questions to help guide us:\n\n1. **What specific aspect of video games interests you?** This could be anything from the cultural impact, their educational potential, the evolution of game design, storytelling in video games, or something else entirely.\n\n2. **Who is your target audience?** Are you aiming to speak to gamers, parents, educators, industry professionals, or a general audience?\n\n3. **What is the primary message or takeaway you want your audience to have by the end of your talk?** \n\nLet's dive into these areas and we can craft an outline from there."
