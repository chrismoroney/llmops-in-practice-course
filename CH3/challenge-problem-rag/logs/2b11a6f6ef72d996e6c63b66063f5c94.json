They murmur to each other and then look with concern at the empty seat. \nJust as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to \nthe podium and begins to read. It’s the same story every year. He tells of the history of Panem, the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America. He lists the disasters, the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land, the brutal war for what little sustenance remained. The result was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts, which brought peace and prosperity to its citizens. Then came the Dark Days, \nthe uprising of the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were defeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and, as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be repeated, it gave us the Hunger Games. \nThe rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In \npunishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland.

If you lift a finger, we will destroy every last one of you. Just as we did in District Thirteen.” \nTo make it humiliating as well as torturous, the Capitol \nrequires us to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity, a sporting event pitting every district against the others. The last tribute alive receives a life of ease back home, and their district will be showered with prizes, largely consisting of food. All year, the Capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us battle starvation. \n“It is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks,” \nintones the mayor. \nThen he reads the list of past District 12 victors. In \nseventy-four years, we have had exactly two. Only one is still alive.

Always close enough to run back to the safety of District 12 if trouble arises. “District Twelve. Where you can starve to death in safety,” I mutter. Then I glance quickly over my shoulder. Even here, even in the middle of nowhere, you worry someone might overhear you. \nWhen I was younger, I scared my mother to death, the \nthings I would blurt out about District 12, about the people who rule our country, Panem, from the far-off city called the Capitol. Eventually I understood this would only lead us to more trouble. So I learned to hold my tongue and to turn my features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever read my thoughts. Do my work quietly in school. Make only polite small talk in the public market. Discuss little more than trades in the Hob, which is the black market where I make most of my money. Even at home, where I am less pleasant, I avoid discussing tricky topics. Like the reaping, or food shortages, or the Hunger Games. Prim might begin to repeat my words and then where would we be? \nIn the woods waits the only person with whom I can be \nmyself. Gale. I can feel the muscles in my face relaxing, my pace quickening as I climb the hills to our place, a \nrock ledge overlooking a valley. A thicket of berry bushes protects it from unwanted eyes.

It holds three chairs, a podium, and two large glass balls, one for the boys and one for the girls. I stare at the paper slips in the girls’ ball. Twenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on them in careful handwriting. \nTwo of the three chairs fill with Madge’s father, Mayor \nUndersee, who’s a tall, balding man, and Effie Trinket, District 12’s escort, fresh from the Capitol with her scary white grin, pinkish hair, and spring green suit.

The sky goes black and I hear a chorus of frogs begin to sing. Stupid! I tell myself. What a stupid thing to do! I wait, frozen, for the woods to come alive with assailants. Then I remember there’s almost no one left. \nPeeta, who’s been wounded, is now my ally. Whatever \ndoubts I’ve had about him dissipate because if either of us took the other’s life now we’d be pariahs when we returned to District 12. In fact, I know if I was watching I’d loathe any tribute who didn’t immediately ally with their district partner. Besides, it just makes sense to protect each other. And in my case — being one of the star-crossed lovers from District 12 — it’s an absolute requirement if I want any more help from sympathetic sponsors. The star-crossed lovers . . . Peeta must have been playing that angle all along. Why else would the Gamemakers have made this unprecedented change in the rules?

My head snaps from side to side as I examine the pack, \ntaking in the various sizes and colors. The small one with the red coat and amber eyes . . . Foxface! And there, the ashen hair and hazel eyes of the boy from District 9 who died as we struggled for the backpack! And worst of all, the smallest mutt, with dark glossy fur, huge brown eyes and a collar that reads 11 in woven straw. Teeth bared in hatred. Rue . . . \n“What is it, Katniss?” Peeta shakes my shoulder. “It’s them. It’s all of them. The others. Rue and Foxface \nand . . . all of the other tributes,” I choke out. \nI hear Peeta’s gasp of recognition. “What did they do to \nthem? You don’t think . . . those could be their real eyes?” \nTheir eyes are the least of my worries. What about their \nbrains? Have they been given any of the real tributes memories? Have they been programmed to hate our faces particularly because we have survived and they \nwere so callously murdered? And the ones we actually killed . . . do they believe they’re avenging their own deaths? \nBefore I can get this out, the mutts begin a new assault\n\n2. out the circular gold pin that was on her dress earlier. I hadn’t paid much attention to it before, but now I see it’s a small bird in flight. \n“Your pin?” I say. Wearing a token from my district is \nabout the last thing on my mind. \n“Here, I’ll put it on your dress, all right?” Madge doesn’t \nwait for an answer, she just leans in and fixes the bird to my dress. “Promise you’ll wear it into the arena, Katniss?” she asks. “Promise?” \n“Yes,” I say. Cookies. A pin. I’m getting all kinds of gifts \ntoday. Madge gives me one more. A kiss on the cheek. Then she’s gone and I’m left thinking that maybe Madge really has been my friend all along. \nFinally, Gale is here and maybe there is nothing romantic \nbetween us, but when he opens his arms I don’t hesitate to go into them. His body is familiar to me — the way it moves, the smell of wood smoke, even the sound of his heart beating I know from quiet moments on a hunt — but this is the first time I really feel it, lean and hard-muscled against my own. \n“Listen,” he says. “Getting a knife should be pretty easy, \nbut you’ve got to get your hands on a bow. That’s your best chance.” \n“They don’t always have bows,” I say, thinking of the \nyear there were only horrible spiked maces that the tributes had to bludgeon one another to death with. \n“Then make one,” says Gale. “Even a weak bow is better \nthan no bow at all.” \nI have tried copying my father’s bows with poor results.\n\n3. My father’s voice comes back to me. “Not these, Katniss. \nNever these. They’re nightlock. You’ll be dead before they reach your stomach.” \nJust then, the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting \nPeeta to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. The hovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away. What’s left of Foxface’s emaciated body is lifted into the air. I can see the red glint of her hair in the sunlight. I should have known the moment I saw the missing \ncheese. . . . \nPeeta has me by the arm, pushing me toward a tree. \n“Climb. He’ll be here in a second. We’ll stand a better chance fighting him from above.” \nI stop him, suddenly calm. “No, Peeta, she’s your kill, not \nCato’s.” \n“What? I haven’t even seen her since the first day,” he \nsays. “How could I have killed her?” \nIn answer, I hold out the berries. \nEnd of Chapter Chapter 24.\n \nIt takes a while to explain the situation to Peeta. How \nFoxface stole the food from the supply pile before I blew it up, how she tried to take enough to stay alive but not enough that anyone would notice it, how she wouldn’t question the safety of berries we were preparing to eat ourselves. \n“I wonder how she found us,” says Peeta. “My fault, I \nguess, if I’m as loud as you say.” \nWe were about as hard to follow as a herd of cattle, but I \ntry to be kind. “And she’s very clever, Peeta. Well, she was. Until you outfoxed her.” \n“Not on purpose. Doesn’t seem fair somehow. I mean,\n\n4. when they drew the tracker jackers in by the lake,” says Rue. “I guess they agreed to let him live if he acted as their guard. But he’s not very big.” \n“What weapons does he have?” I ask. “Not much that I could see. A spear. He might be able to \nhold a few of us off with that, but Thresh could kill him easily,” says Rue. \n“And the food’s just out in the open?” I say. She nods. \n“Something’s not quite right about that whole setup.” \n“I know. But I couldn’t tell what exactly,” says Rue. \n“Katniss, even if you could get to the food, how would you get rid of it?” \n“Burn it. Dump it in the lake. Soak it in fuel.” I poke Rue\n in the belly, just like I would Prim. “Eat it!” She giggles. \n“Don’t worry, I’ll think of something. Destroying things is much easier than making them.” \nFor a while, we dig roots, we gather berries and greens, \nwe devise a strategy in hushed voices. And I come to know Rue, the oldest of six kids, fiercely protective of her siblings, who gives her rations to the younger ones, who forages in the meadows in a district where the Peacekeepers are far less obliging than ours. Rue, who when you ask her what she loves most in the world, replies, of all things, “Music.” \n“Music?” I say. In our world, I rank music somewhere \nbetween hair ribbons and rainbows in terms of usefulness. At least a rainbow gives you a tip about the weather. “You have a lot of time for that?” \n“We sing at home. At work, too. That’s why I love your\n\n5. a piece of my father with me, protecting me. I fasten the pin onto my shirt, and with the dark green fabric as a background, I can almost imagine the mockingjay flying through the trees. \nEffie Trinket comes to collect me for supper. I follow her \nthrough the narrow, rocking corridor into a dining room with polished paneled walls. There’s a table where all the dishes are highly breakable. Peeta Mellark sits waiting for us, the chair next to him empty. \n“Where’s Haymitch?” asks Effie Trinket brightly. “Last time I saw him, he said he was going to take a \nnap,” says Peeta. \n“Well, it’s been an exhausting day,” says Effie Trinket. I \nthink she’s relieved by Haymitch’s absence, and who can blame her? \nThe supper comes in courses. A thick carrot soup, green \nsalad, lamb chops and mashed potatoes, cheese and fruit, a chocolate cake. Throughout the meal, Effie Trinket keeps reminding us to save space because there’s more to come. But I’m stuffing myself because I’ve never \nhad food like this, so good and so much, and because probably the best thing I can do between now and the Games is put on a few pounds. \n“At least, you two have decent manners,” says Effie as \nwe’re finishing the main course. “The pair last year ate everything with their hands like a couple of savages. It completely upset my digestion.” \nThe pair last year were two kids from the Seam who’d\n\nMessage:\nWho are Katniss Everdeen's closest friends?\n"

We do pick up some valuable skills, from starting fires, to knife throwing, to making shelter. Despite Haymitch’s order to appear mediocre, Peeta excels in hand-to-hand combat, and I sweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye. We steer clear of archery and weightlifting though, wanting to save those for our private sessions. \nThe Gamemakers appeared early on the first day. Twenty \nor so men and women dressed in deep purple robes. They sit in the elevated stands that surround the gymnasium, sometimes wandering about to watch us, jotting down notes, other times eating at the endless banquet that has been set for them, ignoring the lot of us. But they do seem to be keeping their eye on the District 12 tributes. Several times I’ve looked up to find one fixated on me. They consult with the trainers during our meals as well. We see them all gathered together when we come back. \nBreakfast and dinner are served on our floor, but at lunch \nthe twenty-four of us eat in a dining room off the gymnasium.

Kicking off my sandals, I tuck my feet to the side and lean my head against Peeta’s shoulder. His arm goes around me automatically, and I feel like I’m back in the cave, curled up against him, trying to keep warm. His shirt is made of the same yellow material as my dress, but Portia’s put him in long black pants. No sandals, either, but a pair of sturdy black boots he keeps solidly planted on the stage. I wish Cinna had given me a similar outfit, I feel so vulnerable in this flimsy dress. But I guess that was the point. \nCaesar Flickerman makes a few more jokes, and then it’s \ntime for the show. This will last exactly three hours and is required viewing for all of Panem. As the lights dim and the seal appears on the screen, I realize I’m unprepared for this. I do not want to watch my twenty-two fellow tributes die. I saw enough of them die the first time. My heart starts pounding and I have a strong impulse to run. How have the other victors faced this alone? During the highlights, they periodically show the winner’s reaction up on a box in the corner of the screen. I think back to earlier years . . . some are triumphant, pumping their fists in the air, beating their chests. Most just seem stunned. All I know is that the only thing keeping me on\n\n3. they've killed them. There was a guy like that a few years ago from District 6 called Titus. He went completely savage and the Gamemakers had to have him stunned with electric guns to collect the bodies of the players he'd killed before he ate them. There are no rules in the arena, but cannibalism doesn't play well with the Capitol audience, so they tried to head it off. There was some speculation that the avalanche that finally took Titus out was specifically engineered to ensure the victor was not a lunatic. \nI don't see Peeta in the morning. Cinna comes to me \nbefore dawn, gives me a simple shift to wear, and guides me to the roof. My final dressing and preparations will be alone in the catacombs under the arena itself. A hovercraft appears out of thin air, just like the one did in the woods the day I saw the redheaded Avox girl captured, and a ladder drops down. I place my hands and feet on the lower rungs and instantly it's as if I'm frozen. Some sort of current glues me to the ladder while I'm lifted safely inside. \nI expect the ladder to release me then, but I'm still stuck \nwhen a woman in a white coat approaches me carrying a syringe. \"This is just your tracker, Katniss. The stiller you \nare, the more efficiently I can place it,\" she says. \nStill? I'm a statue. But that doesn't prevent me from\n\n4. Peeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been \ncrying and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up. I immediately wonder if this will be \nhis strategy in the Games. To appear weak and frightened, to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all, and then come out fighting. This worked very well for a girl, Johanna Mason, from District 7 a few years back. She seemed like such a sniveling, cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were only a handful of contestants left. It turned out she could kill viciously. Pretty clever, the way she played it. But this seems an odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because he’s a baker’s son. All those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broad-shouldered and strong. It will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him. \nWe have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the \ntrain while the cameras gobble up our images, then we’re allowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us. The train begins to move at once. \nThe speed initially takes my breath away. Of course, I’ve \nnever been on a train, as travel between the districts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned duties. For us, that’s mainly transporting coal. But this is no ordinary coal train. It’s one of the high-speed Capitol models that average 250 miles per hour. Our journey to the Capitol \nwill take less than a day.\n\n5. “I hope that’s how people interpret the four I’ll probably \nget,” says Peeta. “If that. Really, is anything less impressive than watching a person pick up a heavy ball and throw it a couple of yards. One almost landed on my foot.” I grin at him and realize that I’m starving. I cut off a \npiece of pork, dunk it in mashed potatoes, and start eating. It’s okay. My family is safe. And if they are safe, no real harm has been done. \nAfter dinner, we go to sitting room to watch the scores \nannounced on television. First they show a photo of the tribute, then flash their score below it. The Career Tributes naturally get in the eight-to-ten range. Most of the other players average a five. Surprisingly, little Rue comes up with a seven. I don’t know what she showed the judges, but she’s so tiny it must have been impressive. \nDistrict 12 comes up last, as usual. Peeta pulls an eight \nso at least a couple of the Gamemakers must have been watching him. I dig my fingernails into my palms as my face comes up, expecting the worst.

But it doesn’t seem real. “There must be a mistake. How . . . how could that \nhappen?” I ask Haymitch. \n“Guess they liked your temper,” he says. “They’ve got a \nshow to put on.

    "content": "The biggest underdog to win the Hunger Games would be Rue from District 11. Despite being small and young, Rue was clever and agile, and she possessed a unique knowledge of trees and plants due to her time working in the orchards of District 11. She was able to use her skills to avoid other tributes and survive for quite a while in the Arena. Rue's ability to form an alliance with Katniss and her understanding of the uncannily humanoid \"mockingjays\" showcased her resourcefulness. However, it's important to note that Rue sadly did not win the Games, but her survival skills and analytical approach to the Games demonstrated that champions could come from the most unexpected places.",
