They think,” I say. “So do you. And you’ve had more practice. Real \npractice,” he says. “You know how to kill.” \n“Not people,” I say. “How different can it be, really?” says Gale grimly. The awful thing is that if I can forget they’re people, it will be no different at all. \nThe Peacekeepers are back too soon and Gale asks for \nmore time, but they’re taking him away and I start to panic. “Don’t let them starve!” I cry out, clinging to his hand. \n“I won’t! You know I won’t! Katniss, remember I —” he \nsays, and they yank us apart and slam the door and I’ll never know what it was he wanted me to remember. \nIt’s a short ride from the Justice Building to the train \nstation. I’ve never been in a car before. Rarely even ridden in wagons. In the Seam, we travel on foot. \nI’ve been right not to cry. The station is swarming with \nreporters with their insectlike cameras trained directly on my face. But I’ve had a lot of practice at wiping my face clean of emotions and I do this now. I catch a glimpse of myself on the television screen on the wall that’s airing my arrival live and feel gratified that I appear almost bored. \nPeeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been \ncrying and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up. I immediately wonder if this will be\n\n2. The sky lights up with the seal, and I watch Foxface\n shine in the sky and then disappear from the world \nforever. He hasn’t said it, but I don’t think Peeta felt good about killing her, even if it was essential. I can’t pretend I’ll miss her, but I have to admire her. My guess is if they had given us some sort of test, she would have been the smartest of all the tributes. If, in fact, we had been setting a trap for her, I bet she’d have sensed it and avoided the berries. It was Peeta’s own ignorance that brought her down. I’ve spent so much time making sure I don’t underestimate my opponents that I’ve forgotten it’s just as dangerous to overestimate them as well. \nThat brings me back to Cato. But while I think I had a \nsense of Foxface, who she was and how she operated, he’s a little more slippery. Powerful, well trained, but smart? I don’t know. Not like she was. And utterly lacking in the control Foxface demonstrated. I believe Cato could easily lose his judgment in a fit of temper. Not that I can feel superior on that point. I think of the moment I sent the arrow flying into the apple in the pig’s mouth when I was so enraged. Maybe I do understand Cato better than I think. \nDespite the fatigue in my body, my mind’s alert, so I let\n Peeta sleep long past our usual switch. In fact, a soft \ngray day has begun when I shake his shoulder. He looks out, almost in alarm. “I slept the whole night. That’s not fair, Katniss, you should have woken me.”\n\n3. what. I feel almost certain that the person she ran from was Thresh and that is his domain. He’d never have heard me from there and, even if he did, I’m up too high for someone his size to reach. \nSo that leaves Cato and the girl from District 2, who are \nnow surely celebrating the new rule. They’re the only ones left who benefit from it besides Peeta and myself. Do I run from them now, on the chance they heard me call Peeta’s name? No, I think. Let them come. Let them come with their night-vision glasses and their heavy, branch-breaking bodies. \nRight into the range of my arrows. But I know they \nwon’t. If they didn’t come in daylight to my fire, they won’t risk what could be another trap at night. When they come, it will be on their own terms, not because I’ve let them know my whereabouts. \nStay put and get some sleep, Katniss, I instruct myself, \nalthough I wish I could start tracking Peeta now. Tomorrow, you’ll find him. \nI do sleep, but in the morning I’m extra-cautious,\n thinking that while the Careers might hesitate to attack \nme in a tree, they’re completely capable of setting an ambush for me. I make sure to fully prepare myself for the day — eating a big breakfast, securing my pack, readying my weapons — before I descend. But all seems peaceful and undisturbed on the ground. \nToday I’ll have to be scrupulously careful. The Careers\n\n4. this boy, Peeta Mellark, and the bread that gave me hope, and the dandelion that reminded me that I was not doomed. And more than once, I have turned in the school hallway and caught his eyes trained on me, only to quickly flit away. I feel like I owe him something, and I \nhate owing people. Maybe if I had thanked him at some point, I’d be feeling less conflicted now. I thought about it a couple of times, but the opportunity never seemed to present itself. And now it never will. Because we’re going to be thrown into an arena to fight to the death. Exactly how am I supposed to work in a thank-you in there? Somehow it just won’t seem sincere if I’m trying to slit his throat. \nThe mayor finishes the dreary Treaty of Treason and \nmotions for Peeta and me to shake hands. His are as solid and warm as those loaves of bread. Peeta looks me right in the eye and gives my hand what I think is meant to be a reassuring squeeze. Maybe it’s just a nervous spasm. \nWe turn back to face the crowd as the anthem of Panem \nplays. \nOh, well, I think. There will be twenty-four of us. Odds \nare someone else will kill him before I do. \nOf course, the odds have not been very dependable of \nlate. End of Chapter\n Chapter 3.\n \nThe moment the anthem ends, we are taken into\n \ncustody. I don’t mean we’re handcuffed or anything, but a group of Peacekeepers marches us through the front door of the Justice Building. Maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past. I’ve never seen that happen though.\n\n5. Just accept it will be a bad night, I tell myself. I try not \nto, but I can’t help thinking of my mother and Prim, wondering if they’ll sleep a wink tonight. At this late stage in the Games, with an important event like the feast, school will probably be canceled. My family can either watch on that static-filled old clunker of a television at home or join the crowds in the square to watch on the big, clear screens, They’ll have privacy at home but support in the square. People will give them a kind word, a bit of food if they can spare it. I wonder if the baker has sought them out, especially now that Peeta and I are a team, and made good on his promise to keep my sister’s belly full. \nSpirits must be running high in District 12. We so rarely \nhave anyone to root for at this point in the Games. Surely, people are excited about Peeta and me, especially now that we’re together. If I close my eyes, I can imagine their shouts at the screens, urging us on. I \nsee their faces — Greasy Sac and Madge and even the Peacekeepers who buy my meat cheering for us. \nAnd Gale. I know him. He won’t be shouting and \ncheering. But he’ll be watching, every moment, every twist and turn, and willing me to come home. I wonder if he’s hoping that Peeta makes it as well. Gale’s not my boyfriend, but would he be, if I opened that door? He talked about us running away together. Was that just a practical calculation of our chances of survival away from the district? Or something more?\n\nMessage:\nWhat are katiniss's general thoughts toward the peace keepers?\n"

    "content": "Katniss Everdeen, the protagonist of The Hunger Games series, generally holds a hostile and distrusting view towards the Peacekeepers. They are the enforcers of the Capitol's strict laws and conducts, directly representing the oppressive regime that she deeply resents. \n\nIn several instances, Katniss's disdain towards the Peacekeepers clearly surfaces. For instance, when Gale is taken away by the Peacekeepers, she panics and pleads him not to let others starve, signifying her distrust and belief that the Peacekeepers are a threat to the ones she loves. Additionally, when she mentions that the tributes are taken into the Peacekeeper's custody right after the anthem, it's implied again that she views them as agents of control restricting their freedom.\n\nDespite this, she recognizes that not all Peacekeepers are the embodiment of the Capitol's tyranny. Like any other group, there are a few who are more sympathetic to the districts. However, generally, she perceives them as instruments of an unfair system, upholding an order that she is forced to rebel against for survival.",

They murmur to each other and then look with concern at the empty seat. \nJust as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to \nthe podium and begins to read. It’s the same story every year. He tells of the history of Panem, the country that rose up out of the ashes of a place that was once called North America. He lists the disasters, the droughts, the storms, the fires, the encroaching seas that swallowed up so much of the land, the brutal war for what little sustenance remained. The result was Panem, a shining Capitol ringed by thirteen districts, which brought peace and prosperity to its citizens. Then came the Dark Days, \nthe uprising of the districts against the Capitol. Twelve were defeated, the thirteenth obliterated. The Treaty of Treason gave us the new laws to guarantee peace and, as our yearly reminder that the Dark Days must never be repeated, it gave us the Hunger Games. \nThe rules of the Hunger Games are simple. In \npunishment for the uprising, each of the twelve districts must provide one girl and one boy, called tributes, to participate. The twenty-four tributes will be imprisoned in a vast outdoor arena that could hold anything from a burning desert to a frozen wasteland. Over a period of several weeks, the competitors must fight to the death. The last tribute standing wins.\n\n2. Taking the kids from our districts, forcing them to kill one \nanother while we watch — this is the Capitol’s way of reminding us how totally we are at their mercy. How little chance we would stand of surviving another rebellion. \nWhatever words they use, the real message is clear. \n“Look how we take your children and sacrifice them and there’s nothing you can do. If you lift a finger, we will destroy every last one of you. Just as we did in District Thirteen.” \nTo make it humiliating as well as torturous, the Capitol \nrequires us to treat the Hunger Games as a festivity, a sporting event pitting every district against the others. The last tribute alive receives a life of ease back home, and their district will be showered with prizes, largely consisting of food. All year, the Capitol will show the winning district gifts of grain and oil and even delicacies like sugar while the rest of us battle starvation. \n“It is both a time for repentance and a time for thanks,” \nintones the mayor. \nThen he reads the list of past District 12 victors. In \nseventy-four years, we have had exactly two. Only one is still alive. Haymitch Abernathy, a paunchy, middle-aged man, who at this moment appears hollering something unintelligible, staggers onto the stage, and falls into the third chair. He’s drunk. Very. The crowd responds with its token applause, but he’s confused and tries to give Effie Trinket a big hug, which she barely manages to fend off.\n\n3. arrive. The square’s quite large, but not enough to hold District 12’s population of about eight thousand. Latecomers are directed to the adjacent streets, where they can watch the event on screens as it’s televised live by the state. I find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the \nSeam. We all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the temporary stage that is set up before the Justice Building. It holds three chairs, a podium, and two large glass balls, one for the boys and one for the girls. I stare at the paper slips in the girls’ ball. Twenty of them have Katniss Everdeen written on them in careful handwriting. \nTwo of the three chairs fill with Madge’s father, Mayor \nUndersee, who’s a tall, balding man, and Effie Trinket, District 12’s escort, fresh from the Capitol with her scary white grin, pinkish hair, and spring green suit. They murmur to each other and then look with concern at the empty seat. \nJust as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to\n\n4. “It’s lovely. If only you could frost someone to death,” I \nsay. \n“Don’t be so superior. You can never tell what you’ll find \nin the arena. Say it’s actually a gigantic cake —” begins Peeta. “Say we move on,” I break in. \nSo the next three days pass with Peeta and I going \nquietly from station to station. We do pick up some valuable skills, from starting fires, to knife throwing, to making shelter. Despite Haymitch’s order to appear mediocre, Peeta excels in hand-to-hand combat, and I sweep the edible plants test without blinking an eye. We steer clear of archery and weightlifting though, wanting to save those for our private sessions. \nThe Gamemakers appeared early on the first day. Twenty \nor so men and women dressed in deep purple robes. They sit in the elevated stands that surround the gymnasium, sometimes wandering about to watch us, jotting down notes, other times eating at the endless banquet that has been set for them, ignoring the lot of us. But they do seem to be keeping their eye on the District 12 tributes. Several times I’ve looked up to find one fixated on me. They consult with the trainers during our meals as well. We see them all gathered together when we come back. \nBreakfast and dinner are served on our floor, but at lunch \nthe twenty-four of us eat in a dining room off the gymnasium. Food is arranged on carts around the room\n\n5. Peeta Mellark, on the other hand, has obviously been \ncrying and interestingly enough does not seem to be trying to cover it up. I immediately wonder if this will be \nhis strategy in the Games. To appear weak and frightened, to reassure the other tributes that he is no competition at all, and then come out fighting. This worked very well for a girl, Johanna Mason, from District 7 a few years back. She seemed like such a sniveling, cowardly fool that no one bothered about her until there were only a handful of contestants left. It turned out she could kill viciously. Pretty clever, the way she played it. But this seems an odd strategy for Peeta Mellark because he’s a baker’s son. All those years of having enough to eat and hauling bread trays around have made him broad-shouldered and strong. It will take an awful lot of weeping to convince anyone to overlook him. \nWe have to stand for a few minutes in the doorway of the \ntrain while the cameras gobble up our images, then we’re allowed inside and the doors close mercifully behind us. The train begins to move at once. \nThe speed initially takes my breath away. Of course, I’ve \nnever been on a train, as travel between the districts is forbidden except for officially sanctioned duties. For us, that’s mainly transporting coal. But this is no ordinary coal train. It’s one of the high-speed Capitol models that average 250 miles per hour. Our journey to the Capitol \nwill take less than a day.\n\nMessage:\nwho would you consider to be the biggest underdog to win the hunger games?

However, she demonstrates resourcefulness, quick thinking, and superior climbing skills that provide her with an advantage in the arena. She can hide effectively and forage for food, skills honed from her life in District 11, which is agricultural and requires such survival skills. Rue's knowledge about plants and tracker jackers plays an integral role in taking down the career tributes and demonstrates her cunning and survival instincts.\n\nDespite her strengths, Rue was still viewed as a weak contender due to her small size and the general negligence of the weaker districts by the Capitol and other tributes. She was certainly an underdog in the brutal environment of the Hunger Games.",
