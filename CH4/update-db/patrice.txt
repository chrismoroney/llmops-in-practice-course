Patrice Smith is a Canadian student from an extremely wealthy and influential family, whose character adds depth to the themes of privilege, responsibility, and the use of power for the greater good in "Space Cadets."
Despite his privileged background, Patrice's personality is defined by kindness, humility, and a genuine desire to make a positive difference in the world. He is thoughtful and empathetic, often serving as a mediator in conflicts and a source of support for his fellow students. Patrice's character challenges stereotypes about the wealthy elite, showing that privilege can be used responsibly and for the benefit of others.
Patrice's primary motivation is to use his family's influence and resources for the betterment of humanity. He dreams of a future where humanity has successfully expanded into space, creating a more inclusive and united society. This idealism, however, is tempered by the weight of knowledge he carries about the true purpose of the Academy and the secrets behind its funding.
In terms of relationships, Patrice forms a close bond with Aisha, with romantic feelings developing between them. He is drawn to her determination, intelligence, and strong moral compass. His friendships with other students, particularly Seamus, are characterized by loyalty and mutual respect.
Patrice likes the sense of purpose he finds at the Academy and the opportunity to work towards a greater good. He enjoys mentoring newer students and finds satisfaction in using his skills to solve problems. On the other hand, he dislikes the secrecy surrounding the Academy's true purpose and struggles with the burden of keeping information from his friends.
Skilled in martial arts and strategy, Patrice often serves as a mentor figure to the newer students. His character arc is tragically interrupted when he is severely injured defending Aisha from a bully, falling into a coma and eventually being sent back to Earth for treatment. This incident serves as a turning point in the story, highlighting the personal costs of their mission and driving Aisha's development.
Patrice's absence in the latter part of the novel creates a void in the group dynamic and serves as a constant reminder of the dangers they face. It also underscores the theme of sacrifice for a greater cause, as Patrice's injury is a direct result of his willingness to stand up for what's right.
Overall, Patrice's character embodies themes of using privilege responsibly, the importance of looking beyond surface-level judgments, and the power of individual action to effect change. His influence on the story and other characters continues even in his absence, shaping their motivations and decisions as they face the challenges ahead.
