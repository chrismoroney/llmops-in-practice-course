That it had been sealed and \nencrypted so deeply that Seamus couldn ’t break it.  \n“Yet he was able to break mine? ” \n“Yes.” \n“Curious, ” Soo -Kyung said . \n“So what did he read? ” \n“Probably the cover story.”  \n“Cover story? ” Aisha asked . \n“I’m not exactly what I appear to be. ” \n“He said that nobody  here is exactly who they appear to be.”  \n“He is very wise,” she smiled a little. “ And cute. ” \nAisha wasn ’t going to let her change the subject. “Just who are \nyou, then? ” \n“According to the files, I ’m one of the children that were hand-\npicked by the regime in  my country to go through the best of \ntraining in everything. Science, technology, martial arts, languages, \npiloting, strategy…a list as long as your arm. ” \n“According to the files? ” \n“Yes. That was planted to explain how I can do the things I do, \nand to dis tract from the truth about who I am. ” \n“Who are you? ” \n“My name is Kim. ” \n“Yes. I know. It ’s a common name in Korea. ” \n“It’s also the name of the family that have controlled the Democratic \nPeople ’s Republic of Korea since its founding over a hundred years ago. \nHow else do you think I survived the nuclear war? ”  Space Cadets  69 \nAisha sat for a moment. The family that had controlled the\n\n2. vertigo that those closer to the front would encounter. She picked one in the back row, next to an Asian girl who looked about Aisha ’s \nage. The girl was intensely reading a book on her tablet, and didn ’t \nlook up as Aisha sat.  \nShe suddenly spoke. “ Aisha Parks, celebrity. ” \nAisha looked at her. “ I’m not sure about that .” \nThe girl looked up, and her intense eyes searched Aisha ’s. “Good \nto know, ” she said finally, reaching a hand out. “ Soo-Kyung Kim, ” \nshe said.  \n“I don ’t need to tell you my name, I guess. ” \nSoo-Kyung smiled. Her plain face lit up when she smiled. She \nwas beautiful.  \n“So where are you from? ” \nSoo-Kyung smiled again. “You haven’ t heard of me? Good. I \nguess I am not a celebrity, either.”  \nSuch an odd an swer, and from Soo -Kyung ’s reaction, it was clear \nthat Aisha ’s confusion was written on her face.  26 Laurence Moroney  \n“I think we are going to be good friends, ” said Soo -Kyung. “I like how \nyou are straightforward. I am too, but that intimidates some people. ” \n“So where are you  from? ” \n“I am from a small village called Sijungho, ” continued Soo -\nKyung. “There’ s not much to see there.”  \n“Sounds Korean, ” said Aisha. “ You from South Korea? ” \n“North  Korea,” corrected Soo -Kyung. “I’ve never even been to \nSouth Korea. ” \nAisha felt her insides go cold. Against her will, she shuddered a \nlittle, and felt a sob begin to escape from her throat. Her father had \ndied as a result of radiation sickness incurred in the second Korean\n\n3. While others, such as Soo -Kyung and Ronaldo, were extremely \neffective flyers that Aisha could never hope to match, she did seem \nto have a knack for strategy. Simms regula rly called upon her to \ncommand groups of flyers against ones that he set up.  \nAt first, his teams won easily. But, over time, she began to see \nhow he thought, and how he did  things. That was his weakness -- his \npredictability.  \nThe first time she beat him, i t was a tough slog and narrow \nvictory. After that, the wins came easier and easier, until he didn ’t \nseem to be much of a challenge anymore. \nHer sessions with Patrice were also extremely rewarding. Not \nonly was she learning a lot about self -defense, she als o found herself \ngrowing in confidence as she understood the art better. She \nremembered the first day that Soo -Kyung had shown her basic \nthrows, and how the smaller girl had held herself. Now she felt more \ncomfortable in her stance. \nShe hadn’ t yet dared go into the mess hall, but she knew the day \nwas coming soon.  \nPatrice became more and more interesting every moment she \nspent with him. He was certainly a very masculine guy, but not the \ncliché musclebound moron that she ’d known around her old school. 86 Laurence Moroney   \nIt went beyond intelligence, too --  there was something deeply \ninsightful about him. When he began to share his hopes and dreams \nfor the future with her, she realized that she wanted to spend the rest \nof her life with him.\n\n4. nodded at Aisha as she wobbled on her feet, taking her first steps like a toddler, and smiled slightly. Her heart fluttered a little as she smiled back.  \n“You’re blushing, ” said Soo -Kyung. “Do you thin k he’s cute? ” Aisha looked back to ensure he was out of earshot. “ If I have a \nweakness, it ’s for sweetness, ” she whispered. “ Don’ t care for the \nlooks as much as the heart, and sweetness is the taste of the heart.”  \n“You’re such a poet! ” \nAisha smiled as they continued walking.  \nThe assembly room was very normal looking, a large area \nsurrounding a raised dais.  \n“I wonder if we ’ll have a school play, ” she heard someone say, \nand others snickered. \nWhen the final kid had entered, a man in a dark  uniform similar \nto the one Smith had worn took his place on the stage.  \n“Welcome to the International Space Academy,” he began, \nlooking around the audience, making sure their eyes were on him. “You have been selected from the best and most suitable people on \nthe planet to come here and to learn the skills you need for the next phase of mankind ’s civilization. ” \nHe stopped, taking in the room. “ Good, now that I have your \nattention, I want this to sink in. This is quite unlike any other school \nyou might have b een to, and quite unlike the videos used to tell \npeople back home what we do. We don ’t call it an Academy  for \nnothing. It ’s not a floating playground. Military -like discipline is\n\n5. whomever was at the door. Quickly, she slipped into her uniform.  \nOn first glance, it looked like it would be too tight, and too form -\nfitting. In reality, it was extremely comfortable. She tested it by \nstretching and bending and it  held very well. Despite its tightness, it \nwas padded slightly with a gel -like material.  \nIt made sense -- in weightless conditions, it was easy to bump \ninto things and the padding in the uniform would protect her from minor scrapes and bruises.  \nThe tightness also meant that the uniform wouldn’ t get caught \non surfaces, and potentially cause injury.  \nThe shoes on the other hand were bulky, leather, masculine \nmonstrosities. She took one off and looked at it. Bending it in her \nhand, she felt its strength and sp ringiness.  \nThey looked like they’ d be great for jumping. It might be fun to \ntry them out in weightless conditions.  \nShe heard Soo- Kyung call the all -clear and stepped back into \nthe apartment.  \nTwo boys were waiting in the foyer with Soo -Kyung, in full \nunifo rm. She recognized one of them as the Canadian boy, Smith, \nfrom disembarkation.  \n“Good evening, ” he said. “I guess we are your welcoming committee.”   \n \nCHAPTER 7  \nSecrets  \nSomeday we will go to the stars. I will not be around to see \nthat day, but, from what I ’ve learned, it will happen in your \ngeneration. We are closer than you might possibly think. If nothing else, I want you to go there. I ’m asking your mother\n\nMessage:\nTell me about Soo Kyung Kim, and some of her best qualities.\n"

Here are some of her striking attributes that could form the material for a thought-provoking talk:\n\n1. **Brilliant and Highly Skilled**: Soo Kyung Kim comes from a difficult background but she's proven herself in numerous disciplines, including science, technology, martial arts, languages, strategy, and piloting. Her training reflects her exceptional intelligence and adaptability. \n\n2. **Mysterious and Intriguing**: Soo Kyung has an air of mystery around her. She's not who she seems, and she certainly has a complex past that piques the interest of those around her. Her story reveals an inner strength and resilience that are worth exploring.\n\n3. **Straightforward and Honest**: One vital characteristic of Soo Kyung is her ability to be straightforward and honest. Despite her mysterious facade, she's capable of being open and frank, strengthening her relationships, especially with Aisha.\n\n4. **Humble and Unassuming**: Despite her skills and intellect, she doesn’t use them to seek fame or attention. She seems to prefer a low-profile approach in life, which speaks a lot about her humility.\n\n5. **Brave and Determined**: Being handpicked by the regime, surviving a nuclear war, and her ability to adapt and excel shows her courage, determination, and survival instincts.\n\nThe above qualities of Soo Kyung Kim are examples of coping mechanisms, resilience, intelligence, and humility. These human qualities are vital to our collective survival and the progress of civilization, making her a compelling character worthy of discussion.\n",

Aisha looked at her hand for a long moment before holding it in \nhers and shaking it. “ Friends, ” she nodded, first smiling, then \ngrinning, and finally embracing the Korean girl in a giant hug.  \nShe surprised even herself at the warmth of her feelings, and \nknowing that she really meant them.    \n \nCHAPTER 11  \nBully  \nWherever you are, and whomever you are, there are people \nwho will, for whatever reason, try to put you down and make life difficult for you. There are many ways to deal with people like this, but there ’s only one truth: You never start the fight, \nbut you always finish it.  \nNo matter the cost … \n \nIT HAD BEEN A LONG  and difficult morning, and Aisha was tired \nand hungry as she entered the mess hall. The doorway was partially \nblocked with other enrollee students.  \nEnrollee was the official name to students like herself who had \ncome through open enrollment, but the  other students had far less \nkind words to describe them. Everything from rabble  to scum  to \nmeteors had been muttered near her. The first two were obvious, the \nthird she had no idea.  \n“When they throw us out the airlock, we’ ll burn up in the \natmosphere as m eteors,” Soo-Kyung had explained one night, \nseemingly unbothered by the implicit threat.  \n“Shouldn’ t we talk to the authorities, ” Aisha had asked. “ They \ncan’t do that, can they? ” \nSoo-Kyung shook her head. “ This isn ’t a public school. It ’s an \nacademy, a mil itary academy. If you do that, the teachers will think\n\n2. with grey/green skyscrapers soaring into the sky, looking like they came straight out of a science -fiction movie. Beyond to British \nColumbia and the dramatic mountains. She looked at scenes of people skiing past snow ghosts, of kids pl aying hockey on outdoor \nfrozen rinks. \nCould this be in my future, she wondered as she slipped into a \npeaceful, happy sleep.   \n \nCHAPTER 14  \nConflict  \nMahatma Gandhi once said, ‘ An eye for an eye would make the \nwhole world blind ’, which is a  wonderful, peaceful, sentiment.  \nBut if you aren ’t willing to poke out your enemy ’s eye, then only \nyou will be blind, and he, fully sighted, will be encouraged and \nempowered to continue in his oppression of you.  \nSo, if your enemy tries to take out your eye, don ’t take out \nhis. Take off his entire head, and make sure he can never hurt \nyou again...  \n \nHAVING PRACTICED  with Patrice and Soo -Kyung, attending the \nfighting contests took a new interest for Aisha.  \n“You shouldn’ t,” said Patrice. “ Not yet. You don ’t wan t to be \ncalled out. ” \n“Called out? ” \n“It’s common. If you are present, and someone calls you out, you \nreally should fight them. And while you ’ve learned and grown a lot, \nyou aren ’t yet ready.”  \n“Can’t I just say ‘ No’?” \n“Sure,” he said, pausing a little, “ but if you do, you have no \nchance of earning any respect with the older kids. You need them on \nyour side if you ’re to get around this Sebastian thing. ” \n“Has he ever called you out? ” \n“Never.”  \n“Why? ”\n\n3. they’ll bring you down to their level and beat you with \nexperience. ” So he ans wered them with a sentence that \ncaptured all of the commandments, without being any of the \ncommandments: “Love the Lord your God with all your heart \nand all your mind and all your soul, and love your neighbor \nas yourself ”. \nWhether or not you follow in his ways, you have to admire \nthe intelligence in this answer. The Pharisees were trying to \nmaneuver him into a fight, but he not only saw that fight, he \nwon it before it began.  \nYou might think it a pity then that they killed him eventually, unless you realize that that ’s probably what he \nwanted all along. They were pawns in his plan. And you \ncan do the same with your enemies. Find what it is that \nthey yearn for, and manipulate them into what you want using that…  \n \nSTAGGERING BACK TO HER  apartment, she was glad t hat the \ncorridors were quiet, and few people would see her. She barely  Space Cadets  77 \nnoticed Soo -Kyung in the common room as she ran past her, into her \nroom, and slammed the door.  \nShe turned the window beside her bed to views of home. Hills, \nfields, oceans and beaches. Anything that wasn ’t this place. It didn ’t \nhelp. If anything, it made things worse, and the yearning within her \nchest hurt worse than the cut on her scalp. \nThere was a soft knock on the door.  \n“Go away, ” she yelled, trying not to sound like she was crying, \nbut she found herself crying all the more.\n\n4. whom were African -American, nobody leapt to her defense. Instead \nthe press turned to her, recorders pointed in her direction, awaiting \nher answer.  \nWhat a bunch of sharks!  \nShe could feel herself begin to sweat as all eyes turned her way. \nTime slowed to a crawl as they awaited an answer. With every \npassing tick, and nothing to say in response, she began to wonder if \nthe man was ri ght. If she really was out of her depth. If she really \ndidn ’t belong here, and she was just fooling herself. Maybe she \nwasn ’t as smart or as capable as she thought she was.  What would Father do in these circumstances? She had always \nlearned of how great and how wise he was. Mother tried to pass \ndown his teachings, but they were often through her filters, and \nAisha was left to parse what the man had really been like, and what \nhe would really do.  \nShe remembered one phrase: Never start the fight, but always fi nish it.  \nThe path was clear. There was a simple way to finish this fight. \nComposing herself as best she could, she smiled, and stood. It still \nfelt like everything was moving in slow motion. Instead of exiting \nthrough the back, she took the steps down from  the stage towards \nthe waiting press, walking towards them.  \nSome began to get upset at her not answering the question. That \nwas the news  they had come for, and they smelled blood in the \nwater. But she maintained her composure, looking straight ahead \nand walking slowly, step -by-step, as they parted before her.\n\n5. Some began to get upset at her not answering the question.

His skin was turning redder now. Was it anger? Embarrassment? It didn ’t matter. She met his gaze, held it for a \nmoment. She  watched him prepare for whatever she was going to \nsay, saw his eyes dilate, his pallor flush.  \nShe gave him a little half -smile, and left the room to ever-\nincreasing volume and shouting.  \nShe finished the fight.  \n***\nHer insides burning, she wanted to get as far away from the press \nroom as possible. She had maintained a calm composure, but the \nman’s words bounced around her head, making her angrier with \neach passing step.  \nBut what if he was right? What if she really was chosen for the \nreasons he had said? She had to admit to herself that she had taken \npride at being the first of her race to be chosen. And with there being so many qualified boys, that the first was a girl. Maybe she shouldn ’t \nhave felt so proud. Maybe she shouldn ’t have let mother ’s \nbraggado cios attitude wear off on her.  The truth of the matter was that she was selected. That she was  \ngoing to be a space cadet.

They share intimacies, fears, and personal stories, suggesting a profound level of trust and mutual understanding.  \n\nRegarding her enemies, an apparent adversary is the character Sebastian. His intention isn't abundantly clear in the segments provided. However, it's hinted that Aisha needs to strategize and gain respect from the older kids to navigate around this Sebastian issue. \n\nAnother antagonist appears to be a hostile reporter who pushes Aisha into a corner during a press event. His loaded question undermines her achievements, causing her to defend herself publicly. The overall hostile environment of public scrutiny and the pressure to live up to expectations could also be interpreted as a collective enemy. \n\nAdditionally, there's a clear conflict between Aisha and unnamed students at the academy who hurl derogatory terms at enrollee students. Their behavior, coupled with the implicit threat of expulsion (joked about as being thrown out an airlock), adds to Aisha's troubles and presents an ongoing hostile atmosphere she has to navigate regularly.",
