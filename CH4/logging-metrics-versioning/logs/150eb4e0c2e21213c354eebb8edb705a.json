As we got older, and \nwe realized how special our relationship was, we realized that it was this thing that poets and writers a nd singers spend so much time \ndescribing. Yet none of them captured the true feelings that we had. \nNone of them could put a frame around what love actually is. ” \nHe stopped, and sat on a flattened boulder. “And then the Caliphate attacked Israel. She was on  a bus \nheaded back from school. I was at a meeting at my father ’s company, \nwhere they were telling us about the Academy, and my father was \npushing for them to take me. The first bombs fell, and the only \nmercy was that she was killed instantly. She didn ’t suffer.”  132 Laurence Moroney   \n“I’m sorry, ” was all she could muster. It didn ’t feel like \nnearly enough.  \n“I didn ’t want to come to the academy, ” he said. “ I didn ’t want to \nleave her, and there was no place for her here. My parents told me \nthat it was God ’s will for me to come. T hat everything, no matter \nhow tragic, was for His perfect will.”  \nShe put her hand on his shoulder, and even though they both \nwore thick padded spacesuits, she could feel him trembling. \n“So I came, ” he said. “ More to get away from them  than anything. \nThen I  learned about this program, and how we can go to the stars. I \nwant to go out there. And every day I ’m going to look for their so -\ncalled God, and his so -called Heaven.”\n\n2. with grey/green skyscrapers soaring into the sky, looking like they came straight out of a science -fiction movie. Beyond to British \nColumbia and the dramatic mountains. She looked at scenes of people skiing past snow ghosts, of kids pl aying hockey on outdoor \nfrozen rinks. \nCould this be in my future, she wondered as she slipped into a \npeaceful, happy sleep.   \n \nCHAPTER 14  \nConflict  \nMahatma Gandhi once said, ‘ An eye for an eye would make the \nwhole world blind ’, which is a  wonderful, peaceful, sentiment.  \nBut if you aren ’t willing to poke out your enemy ’s eye, then only \nyou will be blind, and he, fully sighted, will be encouraged and \nempowered to continue in his oppression of you.  \nSo, if your enemy tries to take out your eye, don ’t take out \nhis. Take off his entire head, and make sure he can never hurt \nyou again...  \n \nHAVING PRACTICED  with Patrice and Soo -Kyung, attending the \nfighting contests took a new interest for Aisha.  \n“You shouldn’ t,” said Patrice. “ Not yet. You don ’t wan t to be \ncalled out. ” \n“Called out? ” \n“It’s common. If you are present, and someone calls you out, you \nreally should fight them. And while you ’ve learned and grown a lot, \nyou aren ’t yet ready.”  \n“Can’t I just say ‘ No’?” \n“Sure,” he said, pausing a little, “ but if you do, you have no \nchance of earning any respect with the older kids. You need them on \nyour side if you ’re to get around this Sebastian thing. ” \n“Has he ever called you out? ” \n“Never.”  \n“Why? ”\n\n3. voice. “I thought you guys were better than that. ” PART ONE:  \nA Letter From My Father  CHAPTER 1  \nDepartures  \nMy Dearest Aisha:  \nI don ’t even know how to begin writing this letter. I look at \nyou now, sleeping in your crib, so small and so helpless, and I \nwish I could be there with you when you ta ke your first steps. \nI wish I could see it when you get on the bus for your first day of school. I wish I could hold you when you come home \ncrying for the first time, realizing that the world is a bigger and badder place than you could have ever imagined.  \nBut I won ’t be. The disease that is tearing through my body \nwill take me away from you soon. And I ’m so very sorry. But, \nso that I won ’t be a distant and mysterious memory, I ’m \nwriting you this letter.  \nFor you have a destiny. A bright and wonderful destiny … \nTHE TRANSPORT PLANE was older and more rickety than she \nwould have expected for one headed to the spaceport. Aisha peered out the window of the plane intently, waiting for her first glimpse of the great cable veering skyward from Kiritimati into the depths of space.  \nIt even had the old -school seats facing each other across a small \ntable. A man sat there, and he was watching her closely.  \n“It’s nothing really special, ” he said. “ You don ’t really see \nanything. It ’s only interesting when a launch happens. ” \n“How often? ” she asked, knowing the answer already. She\n\n4. them in the Academy? She ’d certainly want to be awake to see it.  CHAPTER 5  \nArrival \nThere are many reasons why we fight in wars. Sometimes it is to \ndefend our homes and our families. Sometimes it is to ensure that our way of life can continue. Sometimes it is to go to the \nbully and smash them in the mouth before they can hurt \nsomeone who is defenseless. With great power comes great responsibility, and we have been blessed with great power. The trick is in exercising our responsibility appropriately.  \nThis applies not just on the national level, but on the personal \nlevel. In everything you do, my dear daughter, you will \nexercise that responsibility. Be sure that you are wise in all things. And if you can ’t be, find someone who is, and support \nthem with all your might...  \nTHE LIGHTS SUDDENLY coming on woke Aisha from her reverie. \nTheir transport had docked with the space station, and passengers had already begun disembarkation. She nudged Soo -Kyung, who \nwoke instantly.  \n“We’re here.”  \nStill weightless, they pulled themselves out the airlock into a \nlong corridor. It was featureless, but for the o ccasional blinking LED \nanimation showing them the direction they should float.  \n“As if there was any other way,” said the English boy snidely as \nhe drifted past Aisha. \n“It’s to ensure we keep moving,” said Soo -Kyung, “so we don ’t \nlinger and block the corridor. Not to tell us the direction.

For good \nor for ill. Too many people are extremely talented, and they \nthink their  talent is enough, and that others will do whatever \nis necessary for everything to be completed, freeing them up \nto express their talent in an optimal way.  \nThat is not taking responsibility. My dear daughter, be \nresponsible in everything that you do, from the smallest detail \nto the biggest impact.  \nBe more like the uneducated, unprivileged person who works \nhard to provide for their family, than like the exceptional \nperson who does well at everything, but exudes disdain for \neveryone around them...  \n \nOF COURSE,  AS SOON AS  it was all over, the authorities came \ninto the gym and started to enforce some order.  \n“You’re too late,” said Aisha, her head spinning from the blows \nshe had received from Sebastian.  \nWith her adrenaline surge coming to an end, she just felt dizzy. \nSleepy, even. She just wanted to lie down. Soo -Kyung ran out of the \ncrowd and cradled her head in her arms.  \n“Aisha, ” she said, urgently. “ Look into my eyes. ”  Space Cadets  95 \nShe tried, but her friend was blurry. “ Tired,” said Aisha. “ Just \nwant to sleep. ” \n“No! Stay awake, stay with me.”\n\nMessage:\nGive me a summary of the book in a paragraph.\n"
