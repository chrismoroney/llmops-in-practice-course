They ’re all whiter than I am.”  \n“But, surely, it ’s an international station, sanctioned by the UN? ” \n“Sanctioned  by them, but not paid for  by them, ” said Higgins. “ But \nyou’re asking the wrong questions. ”  Space Cadets  103 \nShe stopped for a moment. What did he mean by ‘ The wrong \nquestions ’? She looked at both men again. Their eyes were piercing \ninto hers, but it wasn ’t quite an interrogative thing. There was almost \naffection in them. Curious and curiouser.   \nBut there was something odd in what they were saying. Why\n\n2. audience , that if he was foiled this time by, say, adult intervention, \nthat the possibility of him being much nastier in private was a \ndistinct one. ” \n“So, you stopped him. ” \n“The only way I knew how. I knew it would probably get me \nkicked out of here,” she said, tears flowing involuntarily from her eyes, \n“but if that’ s the price I had to pay, that ’s the price I have to pay.”  \nCarter leaned back in his seat, regarding her thoughtfully. His \nnext action surprised her. He touched his link and spoke into it.  \n“Heard enough? ” \n“Yes,” came a gravelly voice on the other side. “ I’m coming in. ” \nThe door behind her cracked open, and she turned to see a man \nwalking in. He took a seat be side Carter, and despite herself, she gasped.  \nHis kindly smile made his brown eyes light up, and his greying \nhair was in deep contrast to his dark brown skin.  \n“I’m Ezra Higgins, ” he said in his deep voice. “Pleased to \nmeet you.”  \nShe reached out and shook hands.  \n“I’m Principal of this Academy. ”   \n \nCHAPTER 17  \nHiggins  \nAnd there’ s where I end my letter my dear daughter. There ’s \nwhere I have the last words that I will ever say to you. \nSomeday, I know you will read these. Someday, I hope you \nunderstand them and take them to heart.  \nDon’t obey these words because I wrote them. Take them as \nguidance in finding your own way around what is right and what is wrong. Choose your own path, and stick with it.  \nOnce you ’ve done that, I ’ll know that my life was lived fully,\n\n3. “It’s also the name of the family that have controlled the Democratic \nPeople ’s Republic of Korea since its founding over a hundred years ago. \nHow else do you think I survived the nuclear war? ”  Space Cadets  69 \nAisha sat for a moment. The family that had controlled the \ncountry. That had brought it to war with the West. A war that had \nclaimed the life of her own father. She felt anger growing.  \n“I wasn ’t a part of  it,” said Soo -Kyung. “I am as much a victim as you. ” \nThe pit of Aisha ’s stomach went cold. That war had killed her \nfather. Soo -Kyung ’s family was responsible.  \n“You could judge me for what they did, ” she said. “ But you ’d be \nwrong to do so. You can ’t hold me guilty by association. ” \nAisha sighed. Anger wasn ’t right. She didn ’t want to blame Soo -\nKyung. Finally, she said, “ You sound just like Patrice. ” \n“Patrice? ” \n“Smith. ” \n“Oh. First -name terms now, huh? ” \nShe wasn ’t going to let Soo -Kyung change the topic. “ I don’t \nknow what to say. ” \n“Well, nobody else knows who I am. Only you. If you want to \nreport me, I am at your mercy.”  \n“But the files show you are someone else.”  \n“Files, which in your case, are locked. If you  were to report \nsomething it would probably be believed. They clearly hold you in high regard.”  \n“So, why? ” \n“Why what? ” \n“Why come up here? ” \nSoo-Kyung looked thoughtful for a moment, like she was \nsearching for the right words to say. “ For a new start.

I should never have gone there. \nPlease wake up, so I can tell you to your face. There are so many \nthings I want to tell you. There ’s so much that I want you to know. \nPlease just wake up. ”   \n \nCHAPTER 16  \nPrincipal  \nMy mother always made me read the Bible. Every day or \nevery night, I had to do it. As a child it was really hard to \nunderstand everything in it. I focused on the stories, like \nJob and his suffering, or Jonah and the Whale. She insisted \nit was a ‘ big fish ’, and not a whale, because that ’s what the \nBible said. She liked to take it literally, at  face value, not \nrealizing that such an approach to the book led to most of \nthe inconsistencies.  \nBut one thing I remember reading, because it hit me at the core of my being, was this advice: “ Let your yes be yes, and \nyour no be no, anything else comes from  the Evil one. ” \nThat became a cornerstone of my life, and it, more than \nanything else, allowed me to become the man I am. And I \npass that down to you, my dear daughter. Integrity comes \nfrom what you say as much as what you do. Let your yes \nbe yes. Let your  no be no. Speak the truth, and handle the \nconsequences...  \n \nSHE VISITED THE HOSP ITAL every day, but still there was no \nsign of life from Patrice. He just lay there, sometimes with his eyes\n\n5. “Yes!” Aisha reached towards Soo -Kyung, and rested her hand \non her shoulder. “ And, no, ” she said, knowing that she needed to be \nhonest with Soo -Kyung. “There was something more.”  \n“What? ” \nAisha told her about her own file. That it had been sealed and \nencrypted so deeply that Seamus couldn ’t break it.  \n“Yet he was able to break mine? ” \n“Yes.” \n“Curious, ” Soo -Kyung said . \n“So what did he read? ” \n“Probably the cover story.”  \n“Cover story? ” Aisha asked . \n“I’m not exactly what I appear to be. ” \n“He said that nobody  here is exactly who they appear to be.”  \n“He is very wise,” she smiled a little. “ And cute. ” \nAisha wasn ’t going to let her change the subject. “Just who are \nyou, then? ” \n“According to the files, I ’m one of the children that were hand-\npicked by the regime in  my country to go through the best of \ntraining in everything. Science, technology, martial arts, languages, \npiloting, strategy…a list as long as your arm. ” \n“According to the files? ” \n“Yes. That was planted to explain how I can do the things I do, \nand to dis tract from the truth about who I am. ” \n“Who are you? ” \n“My name is Kim. ” \n“Yes. I know. It ’s a common name in Korea. ” \n“It’s also the name of the family that have controlled the Democratic \nPeople ’s Republic of Korea since its founding over a hundred years ago. \nHow else do you think I survived the nuclear war? ”  Space Cadets  69 \nAisha sat for a moment.

One of the things I really like about \nhim is how calm and controlled he always is. ” \n“Don’t let Seamus hear you say that, ” Aisha teased.  \n“Seamus? ” \n“That there are things you like about David.”  \n“But there are.”  \n“You don ’t know guys, do you? ” \nSoo-Kyung slumped on the bed. “ No,” she said quietly. “ I don ’t.” \n“Really? ” \n“Yeah. Think about where I came from. Think about who I am. \nDo you think a gu y my age could ever possibly be honest with me? \nThose that would claim they liked me were probably prodded into \ndoing so, and maybe some that really did like me were afraid to \nspeak up, so I never really got guys. ” \n“You’re probably better off, ” Aisha smile d. \n“Am I? It leaves me in such doubt, I mean Seamus --” \n“Seamus is one of the good guys, ” said Aisha, sincerely meaning \nit. “One of the really good guys. ” \n“How do you know? ” \n“Because it ’s clear that he knows how  to love.

To be honest, most of the time, when you see a sincere \nguy it ’s because he ’s already with someone else. When they aren ’t \nwith someone, you have to be sure that they are right, and it ’s really \nhard to tell. ” \n“So how do you tell ?” \n“When their words are backed up by their actions,” Aisha said. \n“And when they ’re willing to wait. ” \n“Willing to wait? ” \n“As in, not just trying out every girl that they can. Not just \nbasking in the attention that relationships give them, or not just \ngetti ng into one because everyone else is doing it.”  \n“I see. And if they are willing to be patient in that, they ’ll be \npatient in many other, more important, things too? ” \n“Yes.” \n“And you think Seamus is like that? ” \n“I know  he is. ” \n“And you really think he loves  me?” \n“For sure. The question is, do you  love him?” \n“I think so. I don’ t know, but I think so. ” \n“Then you probably do. ” \n“How can you be so sure? ” \n“It’s obvious, ” Aisha smiled. “ Because you hesitate. You are \nthinking of his feelings, you are considering him. You don ’t want \nto declare that you love him when you might not, because that \nwould possibly hurt him. And you never want to hurt someone \nyou love, right? ” \n“Can’t I just be compassionate? ” \n“Something tells me you ’re passionate. I ’m not sure about the \n‘com’ part! ”\n\n3. nodded at Aisha as she wobbled on her feet, taking her first steps like a toddler, and smiled slightly. Her heart fluttered a little as she smiled back.  \n“You’re blushing, ” said Soo -Kyung. “Do you thin k he’s cute? ” Aisha looked back to ensure he was out of earshot. “ If I have a \nweakness, it ’s for sweetness, ” she whispered. “ Don’ t care for the \nlooks as much as the heart, and sweetness is the taste of the heart.”  \n“You’re such a poet! ” \nAisha smiled as they continued walking.  \nThe assembly room was very normal looking, a large area \nsurrounding a raised dais.  \n“I wonder if we ’ll have a school play, ” she heard someone say, \nand others snickered. \nWhen the final kid had entered, a man in a dark  uniform similar \nto the one Smith had worn took his place on the stage.  \n“Welcome to the International Space Academy,” he began, \nlooking around the audience, making sure their eyes were on him. “You have been selected from the best and most suitable people on \nthe planet to come here and to learn the skills you need for the next phase of mankind ’s civilization. ” \nHe stopped, taking in the room. “ Good, now that I have your \nattention, I want this to sink in. This is quite unlike any other school \nyou might have b een to, and quite unlike the videos used to tell \npeople back home what we do. We don ’t call it an Academy  for \nnothing.

Who would be much better at exploring the \ngalaxy in the name of mankind. ” \n“And are we? ” \n“Jury is still out. ” \nHe smiled, and she couldn ’t help but return it.  \n“So,” he continued, “ we are growing something new up here. A \nnew society, a new way of thinking. They  might think that because \nthey paid for all of this that they own  it. In  reality, they ’ll still likely \nown most  of it. But we want to make sure that there ’s a possibility for \nfreedom to continue as we take our first steps into space.”  \nShe heard the awe in her own voice. “ A new society? ” \n“The concepts of governing peoples on th e surface of a planet \nwill soon be out -of-date and irrelevant. How do you have a \ndemocracy  when people are light years apart? How do you have \ncommunism when you don’ t have closed communities? How do you \nensure a monarchy can thrive across great distances? ” \n“So what are you proposing? ” \n“That good people figure it out by living and breathing up here. \nIt’s not realistic that everybody gets a say, so what if we choose people \nwho are smart, compassionate and fair -minded. What if we bring \nthem up here and make them  the first to go to the stars? To give them \nexposure to what we might encounter out there? And let them figure it out for themselves and tell us  what civilization should look like? ” \n“And you want me  to be a part of that? ” \nHe didn ’t answer, and instead his voice grew serious.\n\n5. ago. He was one of the only ones that wasn’ t awkward around the \nIsraeli kid. He was quiet, but when he spoke he was very passionate. ” He laughed, recalling memories. “ I used to think he was \nan Israeli, too. ” \nHe looked into her eyes and she saw genuine feeling there. “ I’ll \nbe honest with you, ” he continued. “Patrice was somebody that we  Space Cadets  119 \nwere all a little shy around. While we all come from rich and \npowerful backgrounds, his family were head- and-shoulders above \nmost of ours. But he was humble, and while he never flaunted it, the fact that he is who he is made it  so that nobody could ever get close \nto him. We were all a little intimidated, I guess.”  \nShe remembered how she had felt when he had explained it to \nher. How she thought he might be condescending. “ I understand \nwhat you mean, ” she said finally.  \nHe nodded and smiled, bringing the coffee cup to his mouth one \nmore time, before putting it down without drinking. “ You should \ncome to Israel someday if you like this slop, ” he said. “ But it would \nruin you. You ’d never drink coffee again.”  \nShe laughed. “ I’ll take yo u up on that. ” \n“Hopefully he will come with you. ” \nShe smiled and blushed again. “ David, ” she said, quietly.  \n“Yes?” \n“Thank you. ” \n“For what? ” \n“For the last few weeks, when I think of him, I see him lying in \nthat hospital bed, wondering if he ’ll ever wake up. But now, when I \nclose my eyes and think of him, I will see him alive again, being him .\n\nMessage:\nI personally am just thinking who would be the people's general favorite character.
